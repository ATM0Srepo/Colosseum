# Drone Simulation with Colosseum (AirSim) for AI Model Deployment 

## Overview

This project leverages Colosseum (AirSim) in Unreal Engine 5.5+ to create a drone simulation environment for AI model training, testing, and deployment. 

The goal is to train a segmentation model to detect objects, then deploy it in Unreal Engine to visualize bounding boxes around detected entities.
